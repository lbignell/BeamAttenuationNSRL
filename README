- This was copied over from EdepNSRL2014.
- This will be a very simple simulation to calculate the spread in beam energies
  due to the attenuation at the beam window, etc. The thickness of window
  material is determined by the known beam energy prior to extraction, the goal
  beam energy, and the stopping power.

Calculation of window thickness:

  The window material was assumed to be Pyrex glass (NIST composition and
  density = 2.23 g/cm^3). Using pstar, this gives a stopping power at 475 MeV
  of 5.24496 MeV/cm and at 2 GeV of 3.80884 MeV/cm.

  The beam energy prior to extraction was 0.477379978 GeV for nominally 475 MeV
  protons and 2.00165 GeV for nominally 2 GeV protons.

  Based on these values, the 475 MeV beam predicts a glass thickness of 4.54 mm,
  and the 2 GeV beam predicts a glass thickness of 4.33 mm. I'll take the
  average at 4.43 mm.

- I've set up a simple simulation that fires a proton beam at a pyrex target of
  that thickness, and gets the energy deposit (~beam energy lost) in the target.

- The Edep distribution is not Gaussian (it rises sharply at low Edep and has a
  long log-linear tail). There is also a smattering of high energy deposit
  events that are probably due to hadronic/hard scattering interactions.

- 475 MeV beam: mean = 2.316 MeV, stdev = 0.34 MeV.
- 2 GeV beam: mean = 1.643 MeV, stdev = 0.44 MeV.

- The easiest thing to do (and given the fact that the spread is quite small
  -- <0.1% -- it is a fair approximation) is to treat the beam at the target as
  a Gaussian with a mean of the intended beam energy and a standard deviation of
  the simulated standard deviations given above.
